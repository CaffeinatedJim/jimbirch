Horizons - Optimized Drupal for content discovery: search engine optimization
=============================
Holistic SEO and Drupal

For years, search engines and good SEOs have been telling webmasters that creating good content is better than focusing on SEO tricks.  With every update that Google brings, this becomes more and more relevant, as results move away from specific keyword focused results, to results more defined by user intent.

Holistic SEO is the approach in which content, marketing, technical SEO, performance, security, and user experience all come together to create a perfect page.

This presentation will review best practices for a modern approach to content creation using the Entity Reference, Inline Entity Form, Metatag, Panels, and Paragraphs modules.

We will also review optimizing HTML markup using Structured Data vocabularies like Schema.org and JSON-LD, and Performance and Design testing using online tools.

Attendees of this session should have general knowledge of Drupal project management or site building.
